# SORTING-ALGORITHMS-VISUALIZATION-TOOL

## Overview

The `SORTING-ALGORITHMS-VISUALIZATION-TOOL` is an educational tool designed to help users visualize and understand various sorting algorithms. 
This tool provides a step-by-step graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms operate on an array. It is ideal for students,
educators, and anyone interested in learning about sorting algorithms in a more interactive way.

## Features

1. Bubble Sort: Visualizes the process where adjacent elements are compared and swapped until the array is sorted.
2. Selection Sort: Demonstrates how the minimum element is repeatedly selected from the unsorted portion and placed at the beginning.
3. Insertion Sort: Shows how each element is inserted into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
4. Quick Sort: Illustrates the divide-and-conquer approach by partitioning the array around a pivot and recursively sorting the sub-arrays.
5. Heap Sort: Depicts the transformation of an array into a heap and the subsequent extraction of elements to sort the array.
6. Merge Sort: Highlights the divide-and-conquer strategy of recursively splitting the array and merging the sorted sub-arrays.

## How It Works

1. Initialization:
   - The tool starts by displaying the initial unsorted array.
   
2. Visualization:
   - For each sorting algorithm, the tool visualizes the array at various stages of the sorting process.
   - Elements are represented by a series of asterisks (`*`), with each line corresponding to an element in the array.
   - The console screen is cleared and updated to reflect the current state of the array after each significant step or operation.

3. Algorithm Execution:
   - Each sorting algorithm is executed, and the array is updated in real-time.
   - The tool pauses for a short duration between steps to allow users to observe the changes and understand the sorting process.

4. Completion:
   - Once the sorting process is complete, the final sorted array is displayed.
   - Users can compare the initial and final states of the array to see the effectiveness of the sorting algorithm.

## Usage

1. Compile and Run:
   - The tool is implemented in C++ and can be compiled using a standard C++ compiler.
   - Run the compiled program to start visualizing the sorting algorithms.

2. Interactive Visualization:
   - The tool provides a console-based interface where the user can observe the sorting process for each algorithm.
   - Visualization helps in understanding how different algorithms manipulate the array to achieve a sorted order.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of sorting algorithms
- Compatible with both Windows and Unix-based systems

## Example Visualizations

1. Bubble Sort

- Shows adjacent swaps and how the largest unsorted elements "bubble" to the end of the array.

2. Selection Sort

- Highlights the selection of the minimum element from the unsorted portion and its placement at the beginning.

3. Insertion Sort

- Illustrates the process of inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

4. Quick Sort

- Demonstrates the partitioning of the array around a pivot and the recursive sorting of the resulting sub-arrays.

5. Heap Sort

- Visualizes the transformation of the array into a heap and the extraction of the maximum elements to achieve a sorted array.

6. Merge Sort

- Shows the divide-and-conquer approach by splitting the array into sub-arrays, sorting them, and merging them back together.

## Conclusion

The `SORTING-ALGORITHMS-VISUALIZATION-TOOL` provides an interactive and educational way to learn about sorting algorithms. By visualizing each step of the sorting process,
users can gain a deeper understanding of how different algorithms work and how they compare in terms of efficiency and performance.
